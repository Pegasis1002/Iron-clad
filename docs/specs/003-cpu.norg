* 1. Summary
{A brief, one-paragraph summary of the component's purpose
and its role within the larger RISC-V design.}

* 2. Functional Requirements
- {Requirement 1: e.g., The component MUST implement the 
behavior defined in XYZ section of the RISC-V 
specification.}
- {Requirement 2: e.g., The component MUST handle situatio
Y.}
- {Add more requirements as needed.}

* 3. Interface Definition
** 3.1. Input Ports
| Name | Width (bits) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| clk  | 1            | System clock signal. |
| rst  | 1            | System reset signal (active 
high/low). |
|      |              |             |

** 3.2. Output Ports
| Name | Width (bits) | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
|      |              |             |
|      |              |             |

** 3.3. Parameters
{Parameters that allow for static configuration of the 
component, e.g., buffer depth, data width.}
| Name | Type    | Default | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
|      |         |         |             |

* 4. Microarchitecture
{A detailed description of the internal design. This secti
can include diagrams (ASCII or linked), state machine 
descriptions, pipeline stages, and explanations of the dat
and control paths.}

** 4.1. State Machine (if applicable)
- *State 1 (e.g., IDLE)*: {Description of behavior in this
state and transition conditions.}
- *State 2 (e.g., PROCESSING)*: {Description of behavior i
this state and transition conditions.}

** 4.2. Pipeline Stages (if applicable)
- *Stage 1 (e.g., FETCH)*: {Description of operations 
performed in this stage.}
- *Stage 2 (e.g., DECODE)*: {Description of operations 
performed in this stage.}

* 5. Performance & Resource Targets
- *Clock Frequency*: {Target clock frequency in MHz.}
- *Latency*: {Instruction/data latency in clock cycles for
critical operations.}
- *Throughput*: {Data throughput or instructions per cycle
(IPC).}
- *Area/Resource Estimate*: {Estimated resource usage (e.g
LUTs, FFs, BRAMs).}

* 6. Verification Plan
{A high-level strategy for verifying this component. What 
are the critical features to test? What kind of testbench 
needed? What are the key coverage goals?}

- *Test Case 1*: {Verify basic functionality X.}
- *Test Case 2*: {Verify corner case Y.}

* 7. Notes & Open Questions
- {Any miscellaneous notes, design trade-offs considered, 
questions that need to be resolved.}
